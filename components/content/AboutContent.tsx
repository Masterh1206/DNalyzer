      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        Domain Trend Analyzer was born from a simple, frustrating problem: every great domain idea seemed to be taken. As a solo developer and part-time domain investor, I spent countless hours manually checking domain availability, trying to guess market trends, and wrestling with creative blocks. I knew there had to be a better way.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted a tool that didn't just check for keywords, but understood them. A tool that could see the bigger picture, identify emerging trends from real-world data, and help brainstorm names that were not only available but also valuable and brandable. That's when I decided to combine my passion for web development with the power of modern AI.
